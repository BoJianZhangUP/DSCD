Official matlab Implementation of the paper "Image Retrieval Using Compact Deep Semantic Correlation  Descriptors" (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2023.103608) accept to IPM(Information Processing and Management) 2024

The paths of the features are (in the case of oxford5k features): ../data/vgg16/datasets/oxford5k_pool5/
The path to query image features is：../data/vgg16/datasets/oxford5k_nquery_pool5/
(nquery means no cropping of the query images)

Since our method is able to locate the target object, there is no need to use a crop box in the query images to obtain the position of the target object, so we do not crop the query images.

Image data and features can be downloaded via the following link：https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Je2RmpVH3n6QwrFDDc9B0A?pwd=lvyj Retrieve code：lvyj
