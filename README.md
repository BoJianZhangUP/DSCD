Official matlab Implementation of the paper "Image Retrieval Using Compact Deep Semantic Correlation  Descriptors" (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2023.103608) accept to IPM(Information Processing and Management) 2024

The paths of the features are (in the case of oxford5k features): ../data/vgg16/datasets/oxford5k_pool5/
The path to query image features isï¼š../data/vgg16/datasets/oxford5k_nquery_pool5/
(nquery means no cropping of the query images)

Since our method is able to locate the target object, there is no need to use a crop box in the query images to obtain the position of the target object, so we do not crop the query images.
